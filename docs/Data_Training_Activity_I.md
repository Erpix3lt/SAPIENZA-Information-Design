- Highly influenced by the early Apple machines, pre installed hyper card programme, with which you could develop your own programs
- early works of visualizing social economic data -> visualizing time the new york time mentions the word comunism vs terrorsim
- began to visualize data more "activly", plotting tweets "just landed in ...", visualization of tweeting good mornign
- visualizing all the information of the kepler project
- above mentioned did not have any professional motives
- His practise lies between: science, art and design
- now working as a data artist in residence at the new york times
- Coworking with Mark Hensen -> how does shared content move from person a to person b .. -> build a tool called cascade, exploratory tool, https://nytlabs.com/projects/cascade.html
- analogy to an archeologist, when developing these tools with mock data and then deploying them with real data
- exercise of taking single pieces of data, otherwise unseen, then building a narrative and visualisation is highly interseting to him
- worked on the 9/11 memorial. mapping the names of the victims in relationship to each other -> special developed software, algorythm -> dense story/narrative
- openpaths, allowing to upload location data of particpating people. I phone would safe location data. Visualisation of peoples paths. putting data into a human context, thereby it gains meaning.
- believes in the power of empathy when relating data to human context -> issues like privacy arise
- when looking at the location data on our phone, the 1st party -> the user, never sees them
- big data > big business
- inclusion of artist, writes etc. into the realm of big data in order to integrate the human part
